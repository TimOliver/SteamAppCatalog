It is not your average story-based RPG; A Land Fit for Heroes is darker, deeper and very explicit, primarily it\u2019s narrative is targeted towards a mature audience. The main characters are not traditional heroes but outcasts with marred souls and questionable pasts. This is a story and character design with a truly dark twist; readers may be shocked but they will still be enthralled by Morgan\u2019s rich and mysterious dark fantasy presented in an entirely unique format for the book series.","supported_languages":"English","reviews":"\u201cA Land Fit For Heroes can get quite racy in sections. We\u2019re talking sweaty, nasty sex, brutal slayings and even the occasional Fifty Shades-style masochism. If you\u2019re a bit squeamish then you might want to pass, but Game Of Thrones fans will probably enjoy this gritty, adult take on fantasy.\u201d<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/recombu.com\/mobile\/article\/a-land-fit-for-heroes-review-ios-game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >recombu<\/a><br><br>\u201cThe creators of the game did not hesitate for a second to show the harshness as well as the cruel and bloody reality that dominated the middle ages.\u201d<br>7.5 \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.tallon4.com\/2016\/05\/land-fit-for-heroes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Tallon4<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/456210\/header.jpg?t=1465967232","website":"http:\/\/landfitforheroes.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 2 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Network:<\/strong> Broadband Internet connection<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 200 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"ext_user_account_notice":"For Multiplay: Liber Primus Games User Database ","developers":["Liber Primus Games"],"publishers":["Liber Primus Games"],"price_overview":{"currency":"USD","initial":999,"final":999,"discount_percent":0},"packages":[98814],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy A Land Fit For Heroes","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":98814,"percent_savings_text":"","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"A Land Fit For Heroes -
