Play the role of a political leader of Russia, Great Britain, France or Germany. It is up to you to take firm decisions at the crucial period of the European history \u2013 the World Wars ages covering 1914 \u2013 1945.  <br>The main feature of the game is a holistic approach to the state administration model. The player is controlling political, economic, technological and military spheres, which contributes to creating an atmosphere of ruling an actual country.
